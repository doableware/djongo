"""
Specifying 'choices' for a field

Most fields take a ``choices`` parameter, which should be a tuple of tuples
specifying which are the valid values for that field.

For each field that has ``choices``, a model instance gets a
``get_fieldname_display()`` method, where ``fieldname`` is the name of the
field. This method returns the "human-readable" value of the field.
