Distribution License Packs</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of Distribution License Packs.</p><p>Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses available for distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this Agreement.</p><p>Each time Licensee distributes a copy of Redistributables, then one Distribution License is used, and Licensee’s account of available Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.</p><p>Licensee may distribute copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.</p><p>10.4. Payment Terms</p><p>License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice from The Doableware.</p><p>The Doableware will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this Agreement and/or after The Doableware receives a Purchase Order from Licensee.</p><p>A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid balances that remain past due and which have not been disputed by the Licensee in good faith.</p><p>10.5.

Any possible in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities and shall be limited in scope to verify Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Doableware or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Doableware shall be entitled to inspect Licensee’s Records and conduct necessary interviews of Licensee’s relevant employees and Contractors. All such Licensee’s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.</p><p>If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee shall pay to The Doableware any amounts owed for such unauthorized use within 30 days from receipt of the corresponding invoice from The Doableware.</p><p>In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of this Agreement (without limitation, either (i) underpayment of more than 10 % of License Fees or 10,000 euros (whichever is more) or (ii) distribution of products, which include or result from Prohibited Combination, shall be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee shall pay The Doableware’s reasonable cost of conducting such audit.</p><h2 id="12-term-and-termination">12. TERM AND TERMINATION</h2><p>12.1. Agreement Term</p><p>This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and remain in force until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12 (“Agreement Term”).</p><p>12.2. Termination for breach and suspension of rights</p><p>Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the other Party commits a material breach of any obligation of this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within such notice period.</p><p>Instead of termination, The Doableware shall have the right to suspend or withhold grants of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to the Development Licenses, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violates or is reasonably suspected to violate its obligations or terms of this Agreement, and where such violation or breach is not cured within ten (10) business days following The Doableware’s written notice thereof.</p><p>12.3.

Parties´ Rights and Duties upon Termination</p><p>Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement, Licensee shall cease and shall cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates’ and Contractors’) to cease using the Licensed Software under this Agreement. For clarity, a Development License of a Designated User, and all rights relating thereto, shall always terminate at the expiry of the respective Development License Term, even if the Agreement continues to remain in force.</p><p>Upon such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Doableware all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same by Licensee’s duly authorized officer to The Doableware upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.</p><p>Except when this Agreement is terminated by The Doableware due to Licensee’s material breach as set forth in Section 12.2, the Licensee may continue distribution of Applications under the terms of this Agreement despite the termination of this Agreement. In such event the terms hereof will continue to be applicable and govern any such distribution of Applications beyond the expiry or termination of this Agreement. In case of termination by The Doableware due to Licensee’s material breach, Licensee must cease any distribution of Applications at the date of termination of this Agreement.</p><p>Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Doableware prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee pay to The Doableware all such fees within 30 days from the effective date of termination of this Agreement.</p><p>Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications (and therein incorporated Redistributables).</p><p>12.5. Extension of Rights under Special Circumstances</p><p>In the event of The Doableware choosing not to renew the Development License(s), as set forth in Section 3.1 and 3.5 respectively, and where such decision of non-renewal is not due to any ongoing breach or alleged breach (as reasonably determined by The Doableware) by Licensee of the terms of this Agreement or any applicable license terms of Open Source Djongo, then all valid and affected Development Licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2.</p><p>In the event The Doableware is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s), assigned to party, who has assumed The Doableware’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid Development Licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement.</p><p>For clarity, in case of an extension under this Section 12.5, any such extension shall not apply to The Doableware’s Support obligations, but Support shall be provided only up until the end of the respective fixed Development License Term regardless of the extension of relevant Development License, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.</p><h2 id="13-governing-law-and-legal-venue">13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE</h2><p>In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Doableware, a Swedish Company, then:</p><p>i. this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Sweden, excluding its choice of law provisions;</p><p>ii. the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and</p><p>iii. any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of International Chamber of Commerce.

The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Malmö, Sweden and the process shall be conducted in the English language. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p><h2 id="14-general-provisions">14. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2><p>14.1. No Assignment</p><p>Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Doableware, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Modifications</p><p>No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each Party. No term or condition contained in Licensee’s Purchase Order (“Deviating Terms”) shall apply unless The Doableware has expressly agreed such Deviating Terms in writing. Unless and to the extent expressly agreed by The Doableware, any such Deviating Terms shall be deemed void and with no legal effect. For clarity, delivery of the Licensed Software following the receipt of the Purchase Order including Deviating Terms shall not constitute acceptance of such Deviating Terms.</p><p>14.6. Force Majeure</p><p>Except for the payment obligations hereunder, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or non-performance of its obligations hereunder in the event and to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to an event of act of God, terrorist attack or other similar unforeseeable catastrophic event that prevents either Party for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and which such Party cannot avoid or circumvent (“Force Majeure Event”). If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.</p><p>14.7. Notices</p><p>Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page.

No Implied License</p><p>There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with The Doableware and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Licensed Software with any other software or hardware not delivered by The Doableware under this Agreement.</p><p>14.10. Attorney Fees</p><p>The prevailing Party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs in connection with such action, as to be ordered by the relevant dispute resolution body.</p><p>14.11.
