## 4. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

The Licensed Software may provide links or access to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third-Party Software") to implement various functions. Third-Party Software does not, however, comprise part of the Licensed Software, but is provided to Licensee complimentary and use thereof is discretionary for the Licensee. Third-Party Software will be listed in requirements.txt file delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or distribution of Third-Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable license terms of applicable third-party right holders. 

## 5. PRE-RELEASE CODE

The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality, or sample code marked or otherwise stated with appropriate designation such as “Technology Preview”, “Alpha”, “Beta”, “Sample”, “Example” etc. (“Pre-Release Code”).  

Such Pre-Release Code may be present complimentary for the Licensee, in order to provide experimental support or information for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more new functionalities or for other similar reasons. The Pre-Release Code may not be at the level of performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product offering.  The Pre-Release Code may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Doableware prior to the first commercial product release, if any. The Doableware is under no obligation to make Pre-Release Code commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The Doableware assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any Pre-Release Code, but any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee’s own risk and expense. 

For clarity, unless Licensed Software specifies different license terms for the respective Pre-Release Code, the Licensee is entitled to use such pre-release code pursuant to Section 3, just like other Licensed Software. 

## 6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

The Doableware hereby represents and warrants that (i) it has the power and authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement, and (ii) Licensed Software will operate materially in accordance with its specifications.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, The Doableware ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. The Doableware DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. 

## 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND, HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. 

EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, AND (II) BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO The Doableware BY LICENSEE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT LICENSE TERM DURING WHICH THE EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY OCCURRED. 

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN The Doableware AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. 

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSEE SHALL ALWAYS BE LIABLE TO PAY THE APPLICABLE LICENSE FEES CORRESPONDING TO ITS ACTUAL USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE. 

## 8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES

Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the agreed Development License Term or other agreed fixed time period. Support is provided according to agreed support level and subject to applicable requirements and restrictions, as specified in the Support Terms. 

Unless otherwise decided by The Doableware at its free and absolute discretion, Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to additional fees. 

From time to time The Doableware may change the Support Terms, provided that during the respective ongoing Support period the level of Support may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee. 

Unless otherwise agreed, The Doableware shall not be responsible for providing any service or support to Customers. 

## 9. CONFIDENTIALITY

Each Party acknowledges that during the Agreement Term each Party may receive information about the other Party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties (“Confidential Information”). Accordingly, when a Party (the “Receiving Party”) receives Confidential Information from the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”), the Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own confidential and proprietary information.  

Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information to the minimum extent necessary.  

The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade secret laws.

Any possible in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's business activities and shall be limited in scope to verify Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Doableware or the independent auditor acting on behalf of The Doableware shall be entitled to inspect Licensee’s Records and conduct necessary interviews of Licensee’s relevant employees and Contractors. All such Licensee’s Records and use thereof shall be subject to an obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.

Upon such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Doableware all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same by Licensee’s duly authorized officer to The Doableware upon its request, provided however that Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers. 

Except when this Agreement is terminated by The Doableware due to Licensee’s material breach as set forth in Section 12.2, the Licensee may continue distribution of Applications under the terms of this Agreement despite the termination of this Agreement. In such event the terms hereof will continue to be applicable and govern any such distribution of Applications beyond the expiry or termination of this Agreement. In case of termination by The Doableware due to Licensee’s material breach, Licensee must cease any distribution of Applications at the date of termination of this Agreement. 

Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Doableware prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee pay to The Doableware all such fees within 30 days from the effective date of termination of this Agreement.  

Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of Customers to continue use of Applications (and therein incorporated Redistributables). 

12.5. Extension of Rights under Special Circumstances 

In the event of The Doableware choosing not to renew the Development License(s), as set forth in Section 3.1 and 3.5 respectively, and where such decision of non-renewal is not due to any ongoing breach or alleged breach (as reasonably determined by The Doableware) by Licensee of the terms of this Agreement or any applicable license terms of Open Source Djongo, then all valid and affected Development Licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional licenses as set forth in Section 10.2. 

In the event The Doableware is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s), assigned to party, who has assumed The Doableware’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid Development Licenses possessed by the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of this Agreement. 

For clarity, in case of an extension under this Section 12.5, any such extension shall not apply to The Doableware’s Support obligations, but Support shall be provided only up until the end of the respective fixed Development License Term regardless of the extension of relevant Development License, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties.  

## 13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE 

In the event this Agreement is in the name of The Doableware, a Swedish Company, then:  

i.	this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Sweden, excluding its choice of law provisions;  

ii.	the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement; and 

iii.	any disputes, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of one (1), or if either Party so requires, of three (3), arbitrators. The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be held in Malmö, Sweden and the process shall be conducted in the English language. This Section shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 

## 14. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

14.1. No Assignment 

Except in the case of a merger or sale of substantially all of its corporate assets, Licensee shall not be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of The Doableware, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Doableware shall be entitled to freely assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this Agreement. 

14.2. No Third-Party Representations 

Licensee shall make no representations or warranties concerning the Licensed Software on behalf of The Doableware. Any representation or warranty Licensee makes or purports to make on The Doableware’s behalf shall be void as to The Doableware. 

14.3. Surviving Sections 

Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive termination of this Agreement shall so be deemed to survive. Such sections include especially the following: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12.4, 13 and 14.     

14.4. Entire Agreement  

This Agreement, the Appendices hereto, the License Certificate and any applicable quote and Purchase Order accepted by The Doableware constitute the complete agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed herein.   

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement will prevail over the terms of the Purchase Order with respect to such conflict or inconsistency. 

Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that this Agreement prevails over any click-to-accept or similar agreements the Designated Users may need to accept online upon download of the Licensed Software, as may be required by The Doableware’s applicable processes relating to Licensed Software. 

14.5. Modifications 

No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an authorized representative of each Party. No term or condition contained in Licensee's Purchase Order (“Deviating Terms”) shall apply unless The Doableware has expressly agreed such Deviating Terms in writing. Unless and to the extent expressly agreed by The Doableware, any such Deviating Terms shall be deemed void and with no legal effect. For clarity, delivery of the Licensed Software following the receipt of the Purchase Order including Deviating Terms shall not constitute acceptance of such Deviating Terms. 

14.6. Force Majeure 

Except for the payment obligations hereunder, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or non-performance of its obligations hereunder in the event and to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to an event of act of God, terrorist attack or other similar unforeseeable catastrophic event that prevents either Party for fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and which such Party cannot avoid or circumvent (“Force Majeure Event”). If the Force Majeure Event results in a delay or non-performance of a Party for a period of three (3) months or longer, then either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect without any liability (except for the obligations of payment arising prior to the event of Force Majeure) towards the other Party.   

14.7. Notices 

Any notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given and deemed received if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when successfully delivered to the recipient by hand, fax, or special courier during normal business hours on a business day to the addresses specified for each Party on the signature page. Each communication and document made or delivered by one Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language. 

14.8. Export Control 

Licensee acknowledges that the Redistributables, as incorporated in Applications, may be subject to export control restrictions under the applicable laws of respective countries. Licensee shall fully comply with all applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the Redistributables and exercise of licenses hereunder and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including without limitation, all necessary licenses, approvals, permissions or consents, where necessary for the re-exportation of the Redistributables, and Applications. 

14.9. No Implied License 

There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with The Doableware and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Licensed Software with any other software or hardware not delivered by The Doableware under this Agreement. 

14.10. Attorney Fees 

The prevailing Party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs in connection with such action, as to be ordered by the relevant dispute resolution body.  

14.11. Privacy 

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that for the purpose of this Agreement, The Doableware may collect, use, transfer and disclose personal data pertaining to Designated Users as well as any other employees and directors of the Licensee and its Contractors relevant for carrying out the intent of this Agreement. Such personal data will be primarily collected from the relevant individuals but may be collected also from Licensee (e.g. in the course of Licensee’s reporting obligations). The Parties acknowledge that as The Doableware determines the purpose and means for such collection and processing of the applicable personal data, The Doableware shall be regarded as the Data Controller under the applicable Data Protection Legislation. The Doableware shall process any such personal data in accordance with its privacy and security policies and practices, which will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.  

14.12. Severability 

If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. 

14.13. Marketing Rights 

Parties have agreed upon no Marketing rights.
