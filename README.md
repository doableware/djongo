<h2>Driver for allowing Django to use MongoDB as the database backend</h2>


Use MongoDB as a backend database for your Django project, without changing the Django ORM. Use the Django Admin GUI to add and modify documents in MongoDB. 

## Usage:
<ol>
<li> Install djongo:

``` 
pip install djongo
```
</li>
<li> Into settings.py file of your project, add: 

``` 
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djongo',
        'NAME': 'your-db-name',
    }`
}
```
</li>   
   <li> Run <code>manage.py makemigrations &ltapp_name&gt </code> followed by <code>manage.py migrate</code> (ONLY the first time to create collections in mongoDB) </li>
   <li> YOUR ARE SET! HAVE FUN! </li>
</ol>

## Requirements:

  1. Python 3.6 or higher.
  2. MongoDB 3.4 or higher.
  3. If your models use nested queries or sub querysets like:
  
      ```python
      inner_qs = Blog.objects.filter(name__contains='Ch').values('name')
      entries = Entry.objects.filter(blog__name__in=inner_qs)
      ```
     MongoDB 3.6 or higher is required.


## How it works

djongo is a SQL to mongodb query compiler. It translates a SQL query string into a mongoDB query document. As a result, all Django features, models etc work as is.
  
  Django contrib modules: 
<pre><code>  
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',    
'django.contrib.sessions',

</code></pre>
 and others... fully supported.
