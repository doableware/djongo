<h1>djongo</h1>
<h2>Driver for allowing Django to use MongoDB as the database backend</h2>

Use MongoDB as a backend database for your Django project, without changing the Django ORM. Use the Django Admin GUI to add and modify documents in MongoDB. 

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ol>
<li> pip install djongo </li>
<li> Into settings.py file of your project, add: 

``` 
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djongo',
        'NAME': 'your-db-name',
    }`
}
```
</li>   
   <li> Run <code>manage.py makemigrations</code> followed by <code>manage.py migrate</code> (ONLY the first time to create collections in mongoDB) </li>
   <li> YOUR ARE SET! HAVE FUN! </li>
</ol>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>

  1. djongo requires <b>python 3.6 or above.</b>


<h2>How it works:</h2>

djongo is a SQL to mongodb query compiler. It translates a SQL query string into a mongoDB query document. As a result, all Django features, models etc work as is.
  
  Django contrib modules: 
<pre><code>  
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',    
'django.contrib.sessions',

</code></pre>
 and others... fully supported.
